ProgramOne:
Using recursion, write a program that prints the number n a total of n number of times.
The recursion method should then start a new line and print the number (n-1) at total of (n-1) number of times.
This should continue until n is equal to zero.

ProgramTwo:
Write a program that accepts a sentence and outputs the same sentence with all of the vowels in upperCase.
Use a recursive method that accepts the sentence as an argument and returns the final sentence with all of the vowels in capital letters.
