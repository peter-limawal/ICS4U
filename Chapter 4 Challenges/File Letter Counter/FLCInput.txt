mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb, mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow
and everywhere that mary went, mary went, mary went,
and everywhere that mary went, the lamb was sure to go
he followed her to school one day school one day, school one day,
he followed her to school one day, which was against the rules
it made the children laugh and play, laugh and play, laugh and play,
it made the children laugh and play to see a lamb at school
and so the teacher turned him out, turned him out, turned him out,
and so the teacher turned him out, but still he lingered near,
and waited patiently, patiently, patiently,
and waited patiently till mary did appear
mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb, mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow
and everywhere that mary went, mary went, mary went,
and everywhere that mary went, the lamb was sure to go
