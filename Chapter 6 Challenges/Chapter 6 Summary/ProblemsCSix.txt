ProgramOne:
Write a class file that contains the following instance fields:
String name, int birthDate, String birthMonth, int birthYear, String favColour
Also, create the appropriate constructors for the class file.
Demonstrate the class file by asking for someone's information and outputting the profile.

ProgramTwo:
Write a class file that contains data for a university profile.
The class file should contain the follwing instance fields:
String uniName, String uniLocation, int yearEstablished, String uniMotto
Also, create the appropriate constructors, accessors, and mutators for the class file.
In addition to this, create a calculator method that calculates the age of the university,
accepting the current year as an argument.
Demonstrate the class file by creating three different objects and creating a profile summary
of the universities as output.
Not only that, demonstrate the ability to use the accessors, mutators, and calculators
that have been created in the class file.
