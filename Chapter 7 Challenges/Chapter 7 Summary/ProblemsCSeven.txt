ProgramOne:
Write a program that creates an array of size 20 filled with random numbers from 1 to 10.
Find the sum of the array, average of the array, and the difference between the largest and smallest values in the array.

ProgramTwo:
Write a program that creates a two-dimensional array with 2 rows and 20 columns.
The first row should contain 20 football teams in the Premier League.

Write a program that creates an array of size 100 filled with random numbers from 1 to 100.
The program should have the following methods:
A sequential search method
A selection sort method
A binary search method
The program should accept an integer value as a test number and using the sequential search
method once, and the binary search method once, the program should determine if the test
number exists in the array.
